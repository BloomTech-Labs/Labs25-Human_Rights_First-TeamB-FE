## Key Features
### Interactive Map

After testing out a few different maps APIs, including MapBox, we found that the Google Maps API would be the most suitable for this project. It allows us to render upwards of 1000 different markers, cluster them, and maintain interactability with each of the markers. It may be worth exploring heatmaps going forward in this project.

One problem with the MapBox API was that it was extremely laggy with the amount of markers we are required to render to the map.
